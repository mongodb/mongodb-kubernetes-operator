// ReplicaSetPortManager is used to determine which ports should be set in pods (mongod processes) and in the service.
// It is used for the two use cases:
//
// * Determining the port values for the initial automation config and service when the cluster is not created yet.
//
// * Determining the next port to be changed (next stage in the process of the port change) when there is a need of changing the port of running cluster.
//
// It does not depend on K8S API, and it is deterministic for the given parameters in the NewReplicaSetPortManager constructor.
//
// When the replica set is initially configured (no pods/processes are created yet), it works by simply setting desired port to all processes.
// When the replica set is created and running, it orchestrates port changes as mongodb-agent does not allow changing ports in more than one process at a time.
// For the running cluster, it changes ports only when all pods reached goal state and changes the ports one by one.
// For the whole process of port change, the service has both ports exposed: old and new. After it finishes, only the new port is in the service.
