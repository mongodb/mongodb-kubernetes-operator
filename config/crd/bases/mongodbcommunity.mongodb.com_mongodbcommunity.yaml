                  to be accessed outside of Kubernetes. This setting allows you to
                  provide different DNS settings within the Kubernetes cluster and
                  to the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes Operator uses split horizon
                  DNS for replica set members. This feature allows communication both
                  within the Kubernetes cluster and from outside Kubernetes.
