# MongoDB Community Kubernetes Operator #

<img align="right" src="https://mongodb-kubernetes-operator.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Leaf-Forest%402x.png">

This is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which deploys MongoDB Community into Kubernetes clusters.

If you are a MongoDB Enterprise customer, or need Enterprise features such as Backup, you can use the [MongoDB Enterprise Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes).

Here is a talk from MongoDB Live 2020 about the Community Operator:

> The [Community Operator](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator) is something I inherited when I started, but it doesn't get as much attention from us as we'd like, and we're trying to understand how it's used in order to establish it's future. It will help us establish exactly what level of support we can offer, and what sort of timeframe we aim to provide support in ðŸ™‚

## Documentation

See the [documentation](docs) to learn how to:

1. [Install or upgrade](docs/install-upgrade.md) the Operator.
1. [Deploy and configure](docs/deploy-configure.md) MongoDB resources.
1. [Create a database user](docs/users.md) with SCRAM authentication.
1. [Secure MongoDB resource connections](docs/secure.md) using TLS.

*NOTE: [MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/master/) docs are for the enterprise operator use case and NOT for the community operator. In addition to the docs mentioned above, you can refer to this [blog post](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/run-secure-containerized-mongodb-deployments-using-the-mongo-db-community-kubernetes-oper) as well to learn more about community operator deployment*

## Supported Features

The MongoDB Community Kubernetes Operator supports the following features:

> Warning: Currently the operator doesn't support Replicaset deployment with server version >= 7.0. We are working on adding the support for it.


- Create [replica sets](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/)
- Upgrade and downgrade MongoDB server version
- Scale replica sets up and down
- Read from and write to the replica set while scaling, upgrading, and downgrading. These operations are done in an "always up" manner.
- Report MongoDB server state via the [MongoDBCommunity resource](/config/crd/bases/mongodbcommunity.mongodb.com_mongodbcommunity.yaml) `status` field
- Use any of the available [Docker MongoDB images](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/)
- Connect to the replica set from inside the Kubernetes cluster (no external connectivity)
- Secure client-to-server and server-to-server connections with TLS
- Create users with [SCRAM](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/) authentication
- Create custom roles
- Enable a [metrics target that can be used with Prometheus](docs/prometheus/README.md)

### Planned Features
- Server internal authentication via keyfile
