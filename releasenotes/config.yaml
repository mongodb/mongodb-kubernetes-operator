  # Each section from every release note are combined when the
  # CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
  # it does not depend on any information only available in another
  # section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
  # must be readable independently of the other.
  #
  # Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.
